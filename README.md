# My n8n Workflows 🚀

A collection of my custom automation workflows built with [n8n](https://n8n.io/).

## 📂 Workflows

### 1. [Gold AI Analyst](./gold-ai-analyst) 📉
An intelligent financial analyst agent that:
*   Tracks real-time gold prices (Gram, ONS).
*   Uses Anthropic's Claude to generate market commentary in Turkish.
*   Sends daily email reports.

### 2. [Price Tracker](./price-tracker) 🏷️
An automated shopping assistant that:
*   Tracks product prices on e-commerce sites.
*   Compares current price with target price and history.
*   Sends email alerts for discounts or when targets are hit.

## 🛠️ Setup

To use these workflows:
1.  Import the `.json` file from the respective folder into your n8n instance.
2.  Configure the necessary credentials (API keys, Google Sheets, etc.) as described in each project's README.
